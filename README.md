I have used Pytest for creating the tests. <br/>
I have used Postman & swagger for testing the API's. <br/>

### Database Schema:
This implementation has 4 main models: Company, Device, Employee, and DeviceAssign.<br/>
1. `Company` stores information about the companies using the app.<br/>
2. `Employee` represents the company's staff, with a one-to-one relationship to a Django user and employee belongs to the company.<br/>
3. `Device` represents the corporate assets, with information such as their name, description, serial number, condition, and which company they belong to.<br/>
4. `DeviceAssign` represents the assignments of devices to employees, with a foreign key to both the Device and Employee models, as well as the assignment and return dates with device conditions<br/>
